<h3>Birth Rate ðŸ‘¶</h3>
After analyzing and fitting a dataset (available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Birthrate-Analysis/master/births.csv">here</a>) related to population growth to a third degree polynomial regression, I predict a birth rate decrease in the years to come.

<h3>MNIST ðŸ‘¶</h3>
Developed a system of Gridsearchs in order to find the best model to predict handwritten numbers, where SVM offered the best accuracy within the training data and was used to predict values.
